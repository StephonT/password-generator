# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to generate a random password based off of a set characters that a user is prompted to choose from. These characters include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or all characters. <br>
Once the user presses the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts begin to guide the user in generating their random characterized password. The first prompt is asking the user to enter a number between 8 and 128. Once the user chooses the number between 8 and 128, a series of prompts asks the user if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters generated in their password. They have the option to include whichever character they desire. <br>
Starter code such as HTML, CSS, and some Javascript was provided by the Rutgers University Bootcamp, however, I had to write Javascript code in order to get the password to generate once the button was pressed. Please click the link below to use my Password Generator.
